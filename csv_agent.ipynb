After a thorough examination, a diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder affecting the central nervous system was made. Due to the severity of the condition, treatment with a non-FDA approved medication was initiated to help manage the symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life. Close monitoring and follow-up will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.                                                                                                                                                 | 2017-01-01   | PBN488954    | Central Nervous System/ Neuromuscular | nan                      | Pharmacy/Prescription Drugs          | Non-FDA Approved Use     | True          | Dr. James Barber       | Cody Carpenter    | Male             |            52 | 51-64               | AB+                  | W720918648                 |     16217695326 | Schmidtkeallee 53        | Tourism officer           | Michelle Graham, 017438105819. | ['Care', 'Research', 'Insurance', 'Support', 'Public', 'Trial', 'Product'] |\\n|    |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |              |              |                                       |                          |                                      |                          |               |                        |                   |                  |               |                     |                      |                            |                 | 54913 Siegen             |                           |                                |                                                                            |\\n|  4 | VAF235393  | The patient presented with a diagnosis of breast cancer.

Due to the severity of the condition, treatment with a non-FDA approved medication was initiated to help manage the symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life. Close monitoring and follow-up will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.                                                                                                                                                 | 2017-01-01   | PBN488954    | Central Nervous System/ Neuromuscular | nan                      | Pharmacy/Prescription Drugs          | Non-FDA Approved Use     | True          | Dr. James Barber       | Cody Carpenter    | Male             |            52 | 51-64               | AB+                  | W720918648                 |     16217695326 | Schmidtkeallee 53        | Tourism officer           | Michelle Graham, 017438105819. | ['Care', 'Research', 'Insurance', 'Support', 'Public', 'Trial', 'Product'] |\\n|    |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |              |              |                                       |                          |                                      |                          |               |                        |                   |                  |               |                     |                      |                            |                 | 54913 Siegen             |                           |                                |                                                                            |\\n|  4 | VAF235393  | The patient presented with a diagnosis of breast cancer.

Due to the severity of the condition, treatment with a non-FDA approved medication was initiated to help manage the symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life. Close monitoring and follow-up will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.                                                                                                                                                 | 2017-01-01   | PBN488954    | Central Nervous System/ Neuromuscular | nan                      | Pharmacy/Prescription Drugs          | Non-FDA Approved Use     | True          | Dr. James Barber       | Cody Carpenter    | Male             |            52 | 51-64               | AB+                  | W720918648                 |     16217695326 | Schmidtkeallee 53        | Tourism officer           | Michelle Graham, 017438105819. | ['Care', 'Research', 'Insurance', 'Support', 'Public', 'Trial', 'Product'] |\\n|    |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |              |              |                                       |                          |                                      |                          |               |                        |                   |                  |               |                     |                      |                            |                 | 54913 Siegen             |                           |                                |                                                                            |\\n|  4 | VAF235393  | The patient presented with a diagnosis of breast cancer.
