      "Nature of Statutory Criteria/Case Summary:  An enrollee has requested Harvoni for treatment of her hepatitis C virus.  Findings:  The physician reviewer found that according to the most recent joint guidelines issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), all patients with chronic hepatitis C should be treated except those with limited life expectancy due to non-liver-related conditions. This applies regardless of fibrosis stage or viral load. Per the guidelines, treatment-naive genotype 1 patients should be treated with Harvoni for 12 weeks. This guideline recommendation is based on multiple randomized clinical trials, and the medication is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for all patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 regardless of fibrosis stage. For these reasons, the requested treatment with Harvoni is supported as medically necessary for the treatment of this patient’s hepatitis C infection. Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested medication is medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition. Therefore, the Health Plan’s denial should be overturned.  Credentials/Qualifications: The reviewer is board certified in internal medicine with sub-specialty certification in gastroenterology and is actively practicing. The reviewer is an expert in the treatment of the enrollee’s medical condition and knowledgeable about the proposed treatment through recent or current actual clinical experience treating those with the same or a similar medical condition.                                                                                                                                      2\n",
      "Nature of Statutory Criteria/Case Summary:   An enrollee has requested the name brand medication Linzess for treatment of her medical condition. The physician reviewer found that review of the submitted additional documentation fails to demonstrate the medical necessity of the requested medication. Linzess is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicated for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. The additional records submitted, which includes endoscopic and radiologic imaging, provides insufficient evidence that the patient has irritable bowel syndrome or has a diagnosis of constipation, such as infrequent bowel movements, difficulty during defecation or the sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation. Therefore, the request for name brand medication Linzess is not supported as medically necessary. Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested medication is not medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition. Therefore, the Health Plan’s denial should be upheld.  Credentials/Qualifications: The reviewer is board certified in gastroenterology and is actively practicing. The reviewer is an expert in the treatment of the enrollee’s medical condition and knowledgeable about the proposed treatment through recent or current actual clinical experience treating those with the same or a similar medical condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\n",
      "The patient is a 31-year-old female who reports that she has high blood pressure and panic disorder. These issues are not documented in the submitted medical records. The patient wishes to have in-office general anesthesia for routine restorative dental treatment. The Health Plan has determined the use of general anesthesia is not medically necessary.The Health Plan’s denial should be upheld. Review of the submitted clinical documentation reveals no evidence of medical problems that would necessitate general anesthesia for dental treatment. Furthermore, there is no documentation that other options for treatment such as conscious sedation have been used without success. Therefore, I have determined the requested general anesthesia is not medically necessary to assist with the patient’s planned dental procedure.

      "A 61-year-old male enrollee has requested a power wheelchair for treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Findings:  The physician reviewer found that the submitted documentation fails to demonstrate the medical necessity of the requested equipment in this patient’s case.  The records indicate that he has normal strength in the limbs and no range of motion deficits in the limbs that would preclude ambulation or use of a manual wheelchair.  Additionally, it is not clear from the current documentation that the patient’s home is accessible to a power mobility device.  However, manual wheelchairs provide superior accessibility in these types of environments.  This patient has multiple chronic health conditions, such as hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which would benefit from increased physical activity and exercise.  Manual wheelchair use has been shown to provide significant health benefits over power wheelchair use for individuals with mobility impairments.

Findings:  The physician reviewer found that the submitted documentation supports the medical necessity of the requested services.  There is adequate support in the peer-reviewed literature for transcranial magnetic stimulation in this clinical setting.  The American Psychiatric Association has endorsed transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of individuals with depression.  In this particular case, the patient is enduring an acute major depressive episode that is causing significant morbidity and functional impairment.

      "A 59-year-old female has requested approval for past magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast for evaluation of her heterogeneously dense breast tissue with multiple cystic lesions.   Findings:  Three physician reviewers found that the patient has a family history of postmenopausal breast cancer. No positive physical findings. The patient’s mammogram and ultrasound reports have been very equivocal. This has led to MRI evaluation of the breasts where the report was also equivocal and recommendation was made for short-term follow-up with MRI due to abnormal enhancement within several areas. A repeat or follow-up MRI was requested and denied by the Health Plan as being investigational since there is no evidence of increased risk of breast cancer. Conventional imaging including mammography and targeted ultrasound have been equivocal in this patient therefore her provider recommended further evaluation with MRI, which was done. This examination showed some abnormal findings including enhancement patterns that can only be followed with MRI. Since an abnormal MRI was documented in the records, a repeat MRI was the appropriate imaging modality for accurate change, especially considering the enhancement findings. Repeat targeted ultrasound would not provide such analysis. MRI in this instance is the standard of care.  All told, MRI is the most sensitive means for early detection of breast cancer in this clinical setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "A 46-year-old female  has requested approval for breast cancer surgery to be performed by a breast cancer surgical oncologist versus a general surgeon, and breast cancer surgery in a treatment facility that specializes in cancer treatment versus a standard surgical environment for treatment of her right breast carcinoma.   Findings:  The physician reviewer found that currently, there is inadequate data that breast cancer patients who are treated by breast surgeons experience superior outcomes when compared with treatment provided by general surgeons. Further, there is no indication that care provided in specialty centers is superior to that provided in general practices. One of the four surgeons offered by the Health Plan is a trained surgical oncologist, and the other three providers are general surgeons.

Findings:  The physician reviewer found that based on review of the available records, RTC level of care is indicated. This patient is not so suicidal or homicidal that he requires acute hospitalization. However, he is chronically non-compliant and a danger to himself and others, and has markedly impaired level of functioning with refusal to attend school, as well as many oppositional behaviors when he does attend school. Yet he is able to regroup shortly when he is in the hospital. He has had multiple hospital admissions and ED visits within the past six months, with relapses sometimes within one or two days of discharge. This patient requires long-term RTC placement to help him acquire appropriate skills and maintain them long enough so that they will generalize when he is discharged. In addition, he has been given multiple opportunities to engage in outpatient therapies, and either refuses to attend completely or relapses quickly in this setting. All told, long-term RTC is medically necessary for this patient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "A 63-year-old male enrollee has requested coverage for Synvisc One injections for treatment of the enrollee’s right knee osteoarthritis. Findings:  The physician reviewer found that upon review of the relevant scientific evidence, the medical necessity of an additional series of hyaluronan injections is not established for this patient. The above cited literature does not support a positive effect from hyaluronan in osteoarthritis of the knee. While there is an advantage to delaying joint replacement as long as possible, the use of repeated hyaluronan injections is not without risk with possible allergic reaction or infection as complications. Moreover, there is no evidence that one brand of hyaluronan injections is more effective than another. At this time, the use of hyaluronan injections in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee is poorly supported by double-blinded studies and also has a low but present risk of complications. The possibility that the hyaluronic acid molecule will disrupt the effect of inflammatory cytokines affecting osteoblastic and osteoclastic and chondrolytic changes within the knee joint is unlikely. As such, the process of chronic inflammation is not likely to be altered by the hyaluronic acid macromolecule. Further, in the article authored by Colen  et al. which reviewed the use of hyaluronic acid in joints other than the knee joint, it was concluded that there is no strong evidence that hyaluronic acid is superior to other treatments of osteoarthritis such as corticosteroids, physiotherapy or other conservative measures. All told, there is insufficient evidence that an additional course of Synvisc One injections is medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s knee osteoarthritis.    1\n",

Therefore, the health plan&#8217;s denial should be upheld.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

      "Nature of Statutory Criteria/Case Summary: An enrollee has requested Harvoni for treatment of his hepatitis C virus genotype 1a.  Findings:  The physician reviewer found that according to the most recent joint guidelines issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), all patients with chronic hepatitis C should be treated except those with limited life expectancy due to non-liver-related conditions. This applies regardless of fibrosis stage or viral load, and advanced fibrosis is not required for treatment. Per guidelines, treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients should be treated with Harvoni. Patients with viral load of less than 6,000,000 IU/mL can be treated for eight weeks. These guideline recommendations are based on multiple randomized clinical trials (Kowdley, et al; Afdhal, et al). Moreover, the AASLD and IDSA guidelines cite data showing reduced survival with delayed treatment (Jezequel, et al). For these reasons, the requested treatment with Harvoni is supported as medically necessary for the treatment of this patient’s hepatitis C infection. Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested medication is medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition. Therefore, the Health Plan’s denial should be overturned.  Credentials/Qualifications: The reviewer is board certified in internal medicine with sub-specialty certification in gastroenterology and is actively practicing. The reviewer is an expert in the treatment of the enrollee’s medical condition and knowledgeable about the proposed treatment through recent or current actual clinical experience treating those with the same or a similar medical condition.  \n",

      "Nature of Statutory Criteria/Case Summary:  An enrollee has requested  residential treatment center (RTC) services for treatment of her medical condition.  Findings:  The physician reviewer found that there is a lack of clinical evidence to suggest that the patient would not respond to treatment at a less intensive level of care.  She no longer required supervision in a highly structured setting to prevent eating disorder behaviors. In addition, no new problems had arisen and there was no evidence to suggest that re-entry into the community would lead to decompensation that would necessitate readmission to a residential setting. Although she continued to struggle with issues of body image, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem, and required ongoing treatment, this treatment did not require the 24-hour supervised setting of residential level of care. Moreover, the records do not support readmission to RTC level of care. Thus, RTC services and resumption of RTC services were not and are not medically necessary for treatment of this patient’s eating disorder.  Final Result: The reviewer determined that the services at issue were not and are not medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition. Therefore, the Health Plan’s denial should be upheld.  Credentials/Qualifications:  The reviewer is board certified in psychiatry and is actively practicing. The reviewer is an expert in the treatment of the enrollee’s medical condition and knowledgeable about the proposed treatment through recent or current actual clinical experience treating those with the same or a similar medical condition. \n",

      "Nature of Statutory Criteria/Case Summary:  The parent of an enrollee has requested speech therapy for treatment of the enrollee’s medical condition.  Findings:  The physician reviewer found that review of the submitted documentation and medical literature fails to demonstrate the medical necessity of the requested services. The article by Myers and colleagues recommends a comprehensive educational program to include speech therapy for children with autism spectrum disorder. In this case, the patient has been treated with speech therapy and has made slow progress with improvements in mean length of utterance, pronoun use and use of correct verb tense. However, in the school and home setting there is not as much generalization. At this point individual speech therapy is not medically necessary. Continued work on her speech goals and social goals can be treated through ABA services, group speech therapy or a social skills group. In sum, individual speech therapy is not medically necessary in this clinical setting.  Final result:  The reviewer determined that the requested services are not medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition. Therefore, the Health Plan’s denial should be upheld.  Credentials/Qualifications:  The reviewer is board certified in pediatrics with sub-specialty certification in developmental and behavioral pediatrics and is actively practicing.

      "Nature of Statutory Criteria/Case Summary: An enrollee has requested breast tomosynthesis for evaluation of her medical condition.  Findings:  Three physician reviewers found that the current peer-reviewed medical literature supports the use of tomosynthesis in the routine screening population. The addition of digital breast tomosynthesis reduces false positives and increases cancer detection when compared to two dimensional full field digital mammography alone. The data suggests the additional of digital breast tomosynthesis reduces recall rates, allows for separation of structures to differentiate architectural distortion from masses and overlapping fibroglandular tissue, and has increased cancer detection. Thus, in this clinical setting, the use of the digital breast tomosynthesis was likely to be more beneficial for evaluation of the patient’s medical condition than any available standard therapy.  Final Result: Three reviewers determined that the diagnostic procedure at issue was likely to be more beneficial for evaluation of the patient’s medical condition than any available standard therapy. Therefore, the Health Plan’s denial should be overturned.   Credentials/Qualifications:  All three reviewers are board certified in diagnostic radiology and are actively practicing.

      "Physician 1: The patient is a 62-year-old male who is reported to have small vessel disease, not amenable to revascularization. The cardiac catheterization describing the anatomy is not in the documentation provided. His angina is atypical, occurring at rest, but it is reported that he does not generally get chest discomfort while doing exercises. He is only on a beta-blocker for angina. He is also able to use an easy-glider for about half-an-hour a day. The patient’s provider has requested authorization for enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy, which has been denied by the Health Plan.The most recent American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines in 2002 list EECP as a class IIb therapy or “usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence/opinion” (Gibbons, et. al.). It was determined that although two studies found EECP to be generally well tolerated and efficacious, the guidelines do not strongly endorse/recommend it as yet. EECP is however useful in a special subset of patients commonly defined as those with: disabling angina (class III or IV) refractory to maximum medical therapy and not amenable to revascularization.In this case, the documentation provided does not demonstrate the patient meets the class III angina definition of “marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. Angina occurs on walking 1-2 blocks.” The pain at rest is described as atypical, and the patient’s lack of chest pain with exercise is inconsistent with class III angina. Additionally, the patient does not appear to be on maximum medical therapy for angina (a calcium channel blocker or nitrate). Furthermore, while the patient may have anatomy that is unrevascularizable, supporting reports such as the cardiac catheterization report have not been provided.In conclusion, the submitted documentation does not support the use of EECP in this case. The standard medical alternatives for this patient are: maximum medical therapy for angina such as a trial of additional medications, workup and treatment of atypical chest pain for non-cardiac etiologies, review of cardiac anatomy towards revascularization and optimization of other medical issues such as pain, depression and fatigue. Accordingly, I have determined that the requested therapy is not likely to be more beneficial for treatment of the patient’s medical condition than any available standard therapy. The Health Plan’s denial should be upheld.Physician 2: The patient is a 62-year-old male with atypical chest pain. He has risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). The records do not contain objective documentation of CAD. His chest pain has been refractory to conventional medical management for CAD. The provider has requested authorization for enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) to treat atypical chest pain. The Health Plan has denied this request.EECP is an experimental treatment for angina pectoris. It is appropriate for individuals with angina pectoris that cannot be managed by conventional therapies such as medication and/or invasive treatment. There is no peer-reviewed body of literature to support the use of ECCP for atypical chest pain. Therefore, I have determined that the requested therapy is not likely to be more beneficial for treatment of the patient’s medical condition than any available standard therapy. The Health Plan’s denial should be upheld.Physician 3:The patient is a 62-year-old diabetic male with class II to III angina with reported chest pain at rest on medical therapy. The patient’s provider recommended enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy for treatment of angina. The provider states that the patient is not a candidate for surgical intervention due to small vessel disease. The Health Plan has denied coverage for EECP therapy on the basis that it is considered investigational.The patient’s provider states that a recent angiogram showed inoperable small vessel disease. The patient presents with refractory angina, unable to be controlled by medical therapy. The use of EECP is an appropriate treatment for patients in this subset. As per the ACC/AHA recommendation, “…(EECP) should only be used [in this subgroup] in patients who cannot be managed adequately by medical therapy and who are not candidates for revascularization therapies (surgical or interventional).” Therefore, I have determined that the requested therapy is likely to be more beneficial for treatment of the patient’s medical condition than any available standard therapy. The Health Plan’s denial should be overturned. \n",
