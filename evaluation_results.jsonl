Obesity is a multi-causal chronic disease recognized across a patient\u2019s lifespan resulting from long-term positive energy balance and the development of excess adiposity that, over time, leads to structural abnormalities, physiological derangements, and functional impairments. The disease of obesity increases the risk of developing other chronic diseases and is associated with premature mortality. As with other chronic diseases, obesity is distinguished by multiple phenotypes, clinical presentations, and treatment responses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the use of Zepbound (tirzepatide) injection for chronic weight management in adults with obesity, defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m\u00b2 or greater, or who are overweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m\u00b2 or greater, with at least one weight-related condition such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol for use in addition to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Anti-obesity medications, when combined with lifestyle intervention, produce larger weight losses than behavioral treatment alone. A researcher explains that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have repeatedly shown promising results in the reduction of body weight in obese patients with and without diabetes. Tirzepatide is a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable peptide engineered from the native glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) sequence, with agonist activity at both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors. In a trial studying the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults who are overweight or with obesity, researchers reported that treatment with tirzepatide led to substantial, sustained weight loss, with a mean percentage change in body weight at week 72 greater than 20% in subjects on the maximum dosage of 15 mg weekly. The authors noted that lower doses also showed remarkable weight loss, with subjects on the five mg dosage losing about 15% of their body weight during the same time period of 72 weeks. In a follow-up study, researchers reported that continued treatment with tirzepatide led to maintained and augmented weight reduction, with patients who continued on tirzepatide experiencing a further 5.5% weight reduction during a 52-week period. In this case, the patient has a BMI of 32.43 kg/m\u00b2. Her weight gain is iatrogenic secondary to chronic steroid use for the management of autoimmune hepatitis and is having a detrimental effect on her liver function. Weight gain is an established to be a side effect of chronic steroid use that can lead to obesity. In this case, patient meets the FDA criteria for the use of Zepbound as her most recent BMI is noted as 32.43 kg/m\u00b2, with a weight-related comorbidity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity is associated with a range of comorbidities and even a modest weight loss in the range of five to ten percent may significantly improve health&#8208;related outcomes. In this case, the patient also has a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Researchers explain that obesity is an important risk factor for the development of GERD. Researchers report that the prevalence, frequency, and severity of symptoms of GERD increase with increases in the BMI. In this clinical setting, given that Zepbound will help this patient with sustained, long-term weight loss and a reduction in her cardiometabolic risks, the requested medication is medically indicated. Therefore, Zepbound auto-injector pen is medically necessary for the treatment of this patient.Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested medication is medically necessary for treatment of the patient\u2019s medical condition.

The American Association of Community Psychiatrists Level of Care Utilization System (LOCUS) provides a reliable framework for determining the appropriate level of care for adults needing mental health treatment. Using LOCUS, providers score patients on a scale of 1-5 using a six-pronged Dimensional Rating System. The six dimensions include: (1) risk of harm; (2) functional status; (3) medical, addictive and psychiatric comorbidity; (4) recovery environment (a. stressors and b. supports); (5) treatment and recovery history; and (6) engagement. The composite score is then used to determine the level of care needed. Applying the LOCUS framework, the patient meets the criteria for the requested services.For dimension 1, the patient is at serious risk of harm (score 4). This patient has chronic, severe, and persistent suicidal ideation. This would be the focus of his treatment during the time period in question.For dimension 2, the patient demonstrates moderate functional impairment (score 3). The patient has significant conflict with his significant other, and he has otherwise isolated and/or alienated himself from other social contacts.For dimension 3, the patient has significant comorbidities (score 3). Medical conditions exist, or have the potential to develop, which may require significant medical monitoring. The patient has medical conditions including bicuspid aortic valve, dilated aortic root, neuropathic pain, asthma, chronic daily headaches, and insomnia.For dimension 4A, the patient\u2019s recovery environment is moderately stressful (score 3). The patient has significant discord or difficulties in family or other important relationships, particularly his life partner, as well as alienation from social interaction. The patient is also preoccupied with his ongoing medical and psychiatric issues and has doubts that his condition will ever improve.For dimension 4B, the patient\u2019s recovery environment provides minimal support (score 4). In this patient\u2019s case, very few actual or potential sources of support are available. The patient\u2019s parents are deceased. The patient is essentially estranged from his brother. The patient has virtually no other potential sources of support.For dimension 5, the patient has exhibited negligible response to treatment and recovery management (score 5). Past or current response to treatment has been quite minimal, even with intensive medically managed exposure in highly structured settings for extended periods of time. Specifically, the patient\u2019s suicidality has been unremitting. The patient has tried and failed numerous psychotropic medications, brain stimulation, and other modalities for his depression.For dimension 6, the patient has shown minimal engagement and recovery (score 4). The patient responds poorly to treatment and treatment providers. The patient often sabotages his treatment by refusing treatment options or abruptly ending treatment for reasons that appear questionable at times. Overall, he struggles mightily to engage with clinicians.These findings give the patient a composite score of 26, which is consistent with DBT with individual skills in an IOP on a 1-1 basis. Moreover, the requested services are in accordance with the generally accepted standards of mental health and substance use disorder care, clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration, and not primarily for the convenience of the patient or provider.

In this case, the provider noted that this patient\u2019s BMI was 40.65 kg/m2. The patient\u2019s BMI had increased when it was 39.33 kg/m2. An elevated BMI increases the perioperative risks associated with a total knee replacement procedure.

Tumor-treating fields (TTF) is an anti-mitotic treatment, meaning that it actively affects GBM cell division. TTF utilizes alternating electric fields via a transducer array that is applied to the scalp. These electric fields help arrest cell division of the GBM.

Furthermore, there is strong evidence showing improved progression-free survival and overall survival when TTF is added to patients who received chemotherapy or radiation therapy alone. Another key aspect demonstrating the importance of TTF in treating GBM is a strong synergistic role with newer targeted therapies.

Obesity is a multi-causal chronic disease recognized across a patient\u2019s lifespan resulting from long-term positive energy balance and the development of excess adiposity that, over time, leads to structural abnormalities, physiological derangements, and functional impairments. The disease of obesity increases the risk of developing other chronic diseases and is associated with premature mortality. As with other chronic diseases, obesity is distinguished by multiple phenotypes, clinical presentations, and treatment responses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the use of Zepbound (tirzepatide) injection for chronic weight management in adults with obesity, defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m\u00b2 or greater, or who are overweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m\u00b2 or greater, with at least one weight-related condition such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol for use in addition to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Anti-obesity medications, when combined with lifestyle intervention, produce larger weight losses than behavioral treatment alone. A researcher explains that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have repeatedly shown promising results in the reduction of body weight in obese patients with and without diabetes. Tirzepatide is a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable peptide engineered from the native glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) sequence, with agonist activity at both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors. In a trial studying the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults who are overweight or with obesity, researchers reported that treatment with tirzepatide led to substantial, sustained weight loss, with a mean percentage change in body weight at week 72 greater than 20% in subjects on the maximum dosage of 15 mg weekly. The authors noted that lower doses also showed remarkable weight loss, with subjects on the five mg dosage losing about 15% of their body weight during the same time period of 72 weeks. In a follow-up study, researchers reported that continued treatment with tirzepatide led to maintained and augmented weight reduction, with patients who continued on tirzepatide experiencing a further 5.5% weight reduction during a 52-week period. In this case, the patient has a BMI of 32.43 kg/m\u00b2. Her weight gain is iatrogenic secondary to chronic steroid use for the management of autoimmune hepatitis and is having a detrimental effect on her liver function. Weight gain is an established to be a side effect of chronic steroid use that can lead to obesity. In this case, patient meets the FDA criteria for the use of Zepbound as her most recent BMI is noted as 32.43 kg/m\u00b2, with a weight-related comorbidity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity is associated with a range of comorbidities and even a modest weight loss in the range of five to ten percent may significantly improve health&#8208;related outcomes. In this case, the patient also has a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Researchers explain that obesity is an important risk factor for the development of GERD. Researchers report that the prevalence, frequency, and severity of symptoms of GERD increase with increases in the BMI. In this clinical setting, given that Zepbound will help this patient with sustained, long-term weight loss and a reduction in her cardiometabolic risks, the requested medication is medically indicated. Therefore, Zepbound auto-injector pen is medically necessary for the treatment of this patient.Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested medication is medically necessary for treatment of the patient\u2019s medical condition.

Obesity is a multi-causal chronic disease recognized across a patient\u2019s lifespan resulting from long-term positive energy balance and the development of excess adiposity that, over time, leads to structural abnormalities, physiological derangements, and functional impairments. The disease of obesity increases the risk of developing other chronic diseases and is associated with premature mortality. As with other chronic diseases, obesity is distinguished by multiple phenotypes, clinical presentations, and treatment responses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the use of Zepbound (tirzepatide) injection for chronic weight management in adults with obesity, defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m\u00b2 or greater, or who are overweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m\u00b2 or greater, with at least one weight-related condition such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol for use in addition to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Anti-obesity medications, when combined with lifestyle intervention, produce larger weight losses than behavioral treatment alone. A researcher explains that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have repeatedly shown promising results in the reduction of body weight in obese patients with and without diabetes. Tirzepatide is a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable peptide engineered from the native glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) sequence, with agonist activity at both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors. In a trial studying the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults who are overweight or with obesity, researchers reported that treatment with tirzepatide led to substantial, sustained weight loss, with a mean percentage change in body weight at week 72 greater than 20% in subjects on the maximum dosage of 15 mg weekly. The authors noted that lower doses also showed remarkable weight loss, with subjects on the five mg dosage losing about 15% of their body weight during the same time period of 72 weeks. In a follow-up study, researchers reported that continued treatment with tirzepatide led to maintained and augmented weight reduction, with patients who continued on tirzepatide experiencing a further 5.5% weight reduction during a 52-week period. In this case, the patient has a BMI of 32.43 kg/m\u00b2. Her weight gain is iatrogenic secondary to chronic steroid use for the management of autoimmune hepatitis and is having a detrimental effect on her liver function. Weight gain is an established to be a side effect of chronic steroid use that can lead to obesity. In this case, patient meets the FDA criteria for the use of Zepbound as her most recent BMI is noted as 32.43 kg/m\u00b2, with a weight-related comorbidity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity is associated with a range of comorbidities and even a modest weight loss in the range of five to ten percent may significantly improve health&#8208;related outcomes. In this case, the patient also has a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Researchers explain that obesity is an important risk factor for the development of GERD. Researchers report that the prevalence, frequency, and severity of symptoms of GERD increase with increases in the BMI. In this clinical setting, given that Zepbound will help this patient with sustained, long-term weight loss and a reduction in her cardiometabolic risks, the requested medication is medically indicated. Therefore, Zepbound auto-injector pen is medically necessary for the treatment of this patient.Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested medication is medically necessary for treatment of the patient\u2019s medical condition.

The primary rationale for the use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is the inability of a patient to use natural speech to meet all of their daily communication needs. AAC may be used to augment or replace communication for patients with cerebral palsy who are unable to communicate with familiar and unfamiliar communication partners in all situations. Patients may use AAC regardless of their age or current cognitive skills. The use of AAC should encompass a life span perspective. The Researchers report that AAC is multimodal, permitting individuals to use every mode possible to communicate. AAC systems may be unaided, such as with signing and gestures, or aided. Aided AAC systems include nontechnology assistive products such as communication boards or books, while technology-based products may include speech generating devices (SGDs) and mobile technologies. Children whose movement disorders are more severe may experience difficulties using standard human interface devices, such as a mouse and keyboard, and may require modified or specialized solutions to access and control their AAC systems. The TD Pilot is an eye tracking-enabled iPad operating system (OS) device and is an SGD that provides native integration of eye tracking in the iPad OS. It may be used for conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND), spinal cord injury, and cerebral palsy. AAC plays a critical role in supporting communication, play, education, work, leisure, and participation of people with cerebral palsy and other significant physical disabilities. For some, eye-gaze control technology may be the only way of optimizing independent communication and activity. Researchers report that children with weak eye-control skills participate more in computer activities as a result of the eye-gaze assistive technology. Researchers report that eye-gaze assistive technology produces a high positive psychosocial impact in everyday life, even among low-duration users. In this case, the records document that the patient demonstrates smiling/laughing, crying, and eye gazing towards objects and people. He is unable to communicate by pointing, head shaking, or nodding and is unable to imitate oral motor movements. The patient presents with global muscular weakness, or hypotonia, which significantly impedes his ability to produce speech. He is unable to imitate sounds, produce word approximations, or answer yes-or-no questions consistently. The patient\u2019s previous device is no longer appropriate due to his severe hypotonia and global muscular weakness. The motor planning required for switch scanning via head movement in two directions quickly results in fatigue. Eye-gaze access requires less motor planning and physical movement, reducing fatigue. A device with eye gaze access allows a patient to access communication in a wider variety of positions. In this case, the patient has the cognitive ability to learn new tasks, including device operation. He remembers the locations of symbols on the device and recognizes that he may use the device to express his needs. He has the cognitive/linguistic abilities to effectively use AAC or SGD to communicate and achieve functional communication goals. While the patient has a diagnosis of cortical visual impairment, he is able to see and identify symbols. He possesses the visual ability to effectively use a device to communicate functionally. The records document that the patient was able to successfully calibrate the eye gaze accessory, and that during a trial of the TD Pilot and eye gaze accessory, he demonstrated increased independence in activating icons to participate in therapy with appropriate function. In this clinical setting, current medical literature supports the use of the requested equipment.

Obesity is a multi-causal chronic disease recognized across a patient\u2019s lifespan resulting from long-term positive energy balance and the development of excess adiposity that, over time, leads to structural abnormalities, physiological derangements, and functional impairments. The disease of obesity increases the risk of developing other chronic diseases and is associated with premature mortality. As with other chronic diseases, obesity is distinguished by multiple phenotypes, clinical presentations, and treatment responses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the use of Zepbound (tirzepatide) injection for chronic weight management in adults with obesity, defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m\u00b2 or greater, or who are overweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m\u00b2 or greater, with at least one weight-related condition such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol for use in addition to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Anti-obesity medications, when combined with lifestyle intervention, produce larger weight losses than behavioral treatment alone. A researcher explains that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have repeatedly shown promising results in the reduction of body weight in obese patients with and without diabetes. Tirzepatide is a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable peptide engineered from the native glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) sequence, with agonist activity at both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors. In a trial studying the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults who are overweight or with obesity, researchers reported that treatment with tirzepatide led to substantial, sustained weight loss, with a mean percentage change in body weight at week 72 greater than 20% in subjects on the maximum dosage of 15 mg weekly. The authors noted that lower doses also showed remarkable weight loss, with subjects on the five mg dosage losing about 15% of their body weight during the same time period of 72 weeks. In a follow-up study, researchers reported that continued treatment with tirzepatide led to maintained and augmented weight reduction, with patients who continued on tirzepatide experiencing a further 5.5% weight reduction during a 52-week period. In this case, the patient has a BMI of 32.43 kg/m\u00b2. Her weight gain is iatrogenic secondary to chronic steroid use for the management of autoimmune hepatitis and is having a detrimental effect on her liver function. Weight gain is an established to be a side effect of chronic steroid use that can lead to obesity. In this case, patient meets the FDA criteria for the use of Zepbound as her most recent BMI is noted as 32.43 kg/m\u00b2, with a weight-related comorbidity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity is associated with a range of comorbidities and even a modest weight loss in the range of five to ten percent may significantly improve health&#8208;related outcomes. In this case, the patient also has a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Researchers explain that obesity is an important risk factor for the development of GERD. Researchers report that the prevalence, frequency, and severity of symptoms of GERD increase with increases in the BMI. In this clinical setting, given that Zepbound will help this patient with sustained, long-term weight loss and a reduction in her cardiometabolic risks, the requested medication is medically indicated. Therefore, Zepbound auto-injector pen is medically necessary for the treatment of this patient.Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested medication is medically necessary for treatment of the patient\u2019s medical condition.

The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Association of Community Psychiatrists Child and Adolescent Level of Care Utilization System (CALOCUS) provides a reliable framework for determining the appropriate level of care for adolescents needing mental health treatment. Using CALOCUS, providers score patients on a scale of 1-5 using a six-pronged Dimensional Rating System. The six dimensions include: (1) risk of harm; (2) functional status; (3) developmental, medical, substance use and psychiatric comorbidity; (4) recovery environment (a. stressors and b. supports); (5) treatment and recovery history; and (6) engagement. The composite score is then used to determine the level of care needed. Applying the CALOCUS framework, this patient meets the criteria for RTC services in a secure facility. For dimension 1, the patient has been at serious risk of harm (score 4) given his significant compromise in function and risk of harm to self and others prior to admission. The patient has a history of aggression toward others, self-harm, and suicidality. The patient has required multiple prior psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency room visits. The records also document ongoing active substance use, school failure, and high family conflict with poor coping skills. Moreover, the patient eloped from the RTC without permission while at RTC. Indication or report of significant impulsivity and physical aggression, with poor judgment and insight, that are significantly endangering to self and others.For dimension 2, the patient has demonstrated serious functional impairment (score 4) due to his inability to function at school or home, with concerns of running away, substance abuse, and aggression towards self and others with poor social skills. Serious deterioration of interpersonal interactions with consistent conflict or otherwise disrupted interactions with others, which may include impulsive or abusive behaviors. For dimension 3, the patient has significant comorbidities (score 4) considering his diagnoses of autism and PTSD. The patient also has multiple substance use disorders that are in remission due to being in a controlled environment. The patient is noted to have a history of psychosis related to substance use. Uncontrolled substance use is present that poses a serious threat to health if unabated and impedes recovery from the presenting condition. For dimension 4A, the patient\u2019s recovery environment is highly stressful (score 4). The records document a very stressful environment involving severe conflicts with parents and peers. There is a serious disruption of family and social milieu due to severe conflict. For dimension 4B, the patient\u2019s recovery environment provides limited support (score 3) given the ongoing severe conflicts with his parents and not perceiving his parents as supportive. Family has limited ability to respond appropriately to the patient\u2019s developmental needs and problems. For dimension 5, the patient has exhibited poor resiliency and response to treatment (score 4) considering his poor recovery history. Despite seeing a psychiatrist since he was five-years-old, and a history of therapy and hospitalizations, the patient has continued with high-risk behaviors and severe mood and safety concerns. Previous treatment has not achieved complete remission of symptoms or optimal control of symptoms even with intensive and repeated exposure to treatment.For dimension 6, the patient has been incompletely engaged in treatment (score 3) as he has expressed ongoing cravings and he continues to have peer relational conflicts while at RTC. Ambivalent, avoidant, and distrustful relationship with clinicians and other care providers. These findings give the patient a composite score of 26, which is consistent with Level 5 medically monitored residence-based services. This level of care is also supported given the patient\u2019s scores of 4 on risk of harm, functional status and comorbidity. The patient has consistently demonstrated severe compromise in functioning when not in a structured and contained setting. His insight is low, and progress has been slow. The patient has significant relationship issues impairing recovery and severe substance use disorders. Per CALOCUS, he therefore meets Level 5C extended stay criteria. Moreover, the patient has reportedly eloped from RTC in the past. Therefore, dual diagnosis RTC services in a secure facility are medically necessary for treatment of this patient.Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested services are medically necessary for treatment of the patient\u2019s medical condition.

The records also document ongoing active substance use, school failure, and high family conflict with poor coping skills. Moreover, the patient eloped from the RTC without permission while at RTC. Indication or report of significant impulsivity and physical aggression, with poor judgment and insight, that are significantly endangering to self and others.For dimension 2, the patient has demonstrated serious functional impairment (score 4) due to his inability to function at school or home, with concerns of running away, substance abuse, and aggression towards self and others with poor social skills. Serious deterioration of interpersonal interactions with consistent conflict or otherwise disrupted interactions with others, which may include impulsive or abusive behaviors. For dimension 3, the patient has significant comorbidities (score 4) considering his diagnoses of autism and PTSD. The patient also has multiple substance use disorders that are in remission due to being in a controlled environment. The patient is noted to have a history of psychosis related to substance use. Uncontrolled substance use is present that poses a serious threat to health if unabated and impedes recovery from the presenting condition. For dimension 4A, the patient\u2019s recovery environment is highly stressful (score 4). The records document a very stressful environment involving severe conflicts with parents and peers. There is a serious disruption of family and social milieu due to severe conflict. For dimension 4B, the patient\u2019s recovery environment provides limited support (score 3) given the ongoing severe conflicts with his parents and not perceiving his parents as supportive. Family has limited ability to respond appropriately to the patient\u2019s developmental needs and problems. For dimension 5, the patient has exhibited poor resiliency and response to treatment (score 4) considering his poor recovery history. Despite seeing a psychiatrist since he was five-years-old, and a history of therapy and hospitalizations, the patient has continued with high-risk behaviors and severe mood and safety concerns. Previous treatment has not achieved complete remission of symptoms or optimal control of symptoms even with intensive and repeated exposure to treatment.For dimension 6, the patient has been incompletely engaged in treatment (score 3) as he has expressed ongoing cravings and he continues to have peer relational conflicts while at RTC. Ambivalent, avoidant, and distrustful relationship with clinicians and other care providers. These findings give the patient a composite score of 26, which is consistent with Level 5 medically monitored residence-based services. This level of care is also supported given the patient\u2019s scores of 4 on risk of harm, functional status and comorbidity. The patient has consistently demonstrated severe compromise in functioning when not in a structured and contained setting. His insight is low, and progress has been slow. The patient has significant relationship issues impairing recovery and severe substance use disorders. Per CALOCUS, he therefore meets Level 5C extended stay criteria. Moreover, the patient has reportedly eloped from RTC in the past. Therefore, dual diagnosis RTC services in a secure facility are medically necessary for treatment of this patient.Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested services are medically necessary for treatment of the patient\u2019s medical condition. Therefore, the Health Plan\u2019s denial should be overturned. Credentials/Qualifications: The reviewer is board certified in psychiatry with subspecialty certification in child and adolescent psychiatry and is actively practicing. The reviewer is an expert in the treatment of the enrollee\u2019s medical condition and knowledgeable about the proposed treatment through recent or current actual clinical experience treating those with the same or a similar medical condition.

However, there is a lack of documentation that the patient\u2019s pannus is causing significant functional problems or systemic illness to support an indication for panniculectomy to support the medical necessity of the requested panniculectomy. The patient is able to work, perform activities of daily living, and wear clothing. Women\u2019s pants  and skirts typically fit at mid-waist. The pictures provided suggest that the patient should be able to wear pants and skirts. According to Ali and colleagues, a patient\u2019s pannus is excess skin and soft tissue that hangs below the umbilicus. The authors noted that a pannus may develop into a pathologic entity in obese patients causing infections skin ulcerations as well as difficulty with hygiene. Janis and colleagues commented that when a patient\u2019s pannus leads to significant functional problems, rashes, or systemic illness, then resection of the pannus can be addressed with an abdominal contouring procedure. The two most common abdominal contouring procedures are panniculectomy and abdominoplasty. Both panniculectomy and abdominoplasty involve removing the excess skin and soft tissue of the lower abdomen, while abdominoplasty also includes a fascial plication of the abdominal wall. The authors noted that a panniculectomy is performed to relieve functional symptoms from excess abdominal skin and subcutaneous tissue, while abdominoplasty is performed for cosmetic reasons. Similarly, Janis and colleagues concluded that the goal of panniculectomy is to relieve the symptoms caused by excess skin. Accordingly, the requested panniculectomy is not medically necessary for treatment of this patient. The California reconstructive surgery statute requires health insurers to cover reconstructive surgeries, defined as surgery performed to correct or repair abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease to do either of the following: (1) to improve function; or (2) to create a normal appearance, to the extent possible. Applying this statute, the requested panniculectomy is reconstructive in nature for treatment of this patient. The patient is obese and has a pannus, but this is not considered an abnormal structure of the body caused by congenital defect, developmental abnormality, infection, tumor, or disease. On review of this patient\u2019s records, the patient\u2019s pannus is an abnormality that occurred after surgery, which is due to trauma. The provider did not chart the presence of a pannus in the patient\u2019s history and physical, but the provider reported that the patient had a pannus in the operative note. The photographs show the patient wearing sweatpants that fit properly with some evidence of a slightly larger pannus on the left side than on the right. On review of the available documentation and photographs, the requested panniculectomy will improve the appearance of the patient\u2019s defect that was created by surgery. The panniculectomy will require removal of more tissue on the left side than on the right side to create a more normal appearance. Based on the medical information received, the requested panniculectomy is likely to provide more than a minimal improvement in the patient\u2019s appearance. Therefore, the requested panniculectomy is reconstructive in nature for treatment of this patient. Given these findings, the requested panniculectomy is medically necessary and reconstructive in nature for treatment of this patient.

This instrument provides a reliable framework for determining the appropriate level of care for adolescents needing mental health treatment. Using CALOCUS-CASII, providers score patients on a scale of 1-5 using a six-pronged Dimensional Rating System. The six dimensions include: (1) risk of harm; (2) functional status; (3) developmental, medical, substance use, and psychiatric comorbidity; (4) recovery environment (a. stressors and b. supports); (5) resiliency and response to services; and (6) engagement. The composite score is then used to determine the level of care needed. Applying the CALOCUS-CASII framework, this patient meets the criteria for RTC services.For dimension 1, the patient was at serious risk of harm (score 4) due to a history of three previous suicide attempts. However, the patient has denied suicidal ideation while in RTC. The patient has a history of substance use beginning at age 10. The patient exhibits a recent pattern of excessive substance use, resulting in clearly harmful behaviors with no demonstrated ability of the adolescent or family to restrict the patient. Further, there is a clear and persistent inability, given the patient\u2019s developmental stage, to maintain physical safety. In addition, the record establishes an imminent risk of severe victimization and/or abuse. For dimension 2, the patient demonstrated moderate functional impairment (score 3). Prior to admission, the patient\u2019s activities of daily living (ADL) had diminished, and she needed reminders to complete them. Therefore, there have been recent gains in stabilization in functioning which have been achieved while participating in treatment in a structured, protected, and enriched service. For dimension 3, the patient has major co-occurrences (score 4) since clinical documentation notes that the patient has multiple substance use disorders in addition to her psychiatric disorders. Thus, the record establishes uncontrolled substance use is present that poses a serious threat to health if unabated and impedes recovery from the presenting condition. For dimension 4A, the patient\u2019s recovery environment was highly stressful (score 4). The patient\u2019s parents acknowledge their difficulties in supporting the patient with her mental health struggles. In addition, the patient\u2019s friend group uses drugs. All told, there is difficulty avoiding exposure to substance use and its effects. For dimension 4B, the patient has limited support in her recovery environment (score 3). Thus, the record indicates that the patient\u2019s family demonstrates only a partial ability to make necessary changes during treatment.For dimension 5, the patient exhibited poor resiliency and response to services (score 4) since the patient\u2019s prior treatment has included outpatient therapy, psychiatric care, and psychotropic medications, a partial hospital program, a wilderness therapy program, a therapeutic boarding school, and two residential treatment programs. In addition, the patient\u2019s previous treatment has not achieved complete remission of symptoms or optimal control of symptoms even with intensive and repeated exposure to interventions.  For dimension 6, the patient\u2019s participation in services was limited (score 3). Although the patient has participated in individual, group, and family therapy while in RTC and is noted to be motivated, she demonstrates poor insight and judgment. Therefore, the record reveals that the patient minimizes and rationalizes distressing behaviors and consequences. These findings give the patient a composite score of 25, which is consistent with Level 5, medically monitored residence-based services. Moreover, the RTC services provided. were and are in accordance with the generally accepted standards of mental health and substance use disorder care, clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration, and not primarily for the convenience of the patient or provider.

Findings:  Two of the three physician reviewers found the Rezum procedure (transurethral water vapor thermal therapy; CPT 53854) was not likely to be more beneficial for treatment of the patient\u2019s medical condition than any available standard therapy.Final Result: The reviewers determined that the services at issue were not likely to be more beneficial for treatment of the patient\u2019s medical condition than any available standard therapy. Therefore, the Health Plan\u2019s denial should be upheld. Credentials/Qualifications: Physician reviewers 1, 2, and 3 are board certified in urology and are actively practicing.

Findings: Patients who have undergone a previous cesarean birth have the option of proceeding with a trial of labor after cesarean section (TOLAC) or planned repeat cesarean birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Planned TOLAC may result in labor with vaginal birth (VBAC) or unplanned intrapartum cesarean birth. Decision-making regarding mode of birth must take into consideration the patient\u2019s personal preferences and obstetric history, the best available data on the risks and benefits of TOLAC versus planned repeat cesarean birth, and the availability of TOLAC in the selected birth setting. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that TOLAC delivery should be attempted at facilities capable of performing emergency deliveries, in a level I center, meaning  one that can provide basic care, or higher. Due to the risks associated with TOLAC, and the unpredictable nature of uterine rupture and other complications, ACOG recommends that TOLAC be attempted in facilities that can provide cesarean delivery for situations that are immediate threats to the life of the woman or fetus. Current medical literature notes that the most important factor associated with failed TOLAC was a prior cesarean birth for a recurring indication, such as failure to progress. Unlike most medical decisions in which patients are comparing risks and benefits for themselves, the pregnant patient must compare risks and benefits for both themselves and their fetus, which sometimes do not alight. However, a strong maternal desire to achieve a birth via out-of-hospital TOLAC poses an increased risk to both mother and child.
